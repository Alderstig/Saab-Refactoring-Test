# Refactoring Test

## Assignment
You are asked to refactor the TicketService.
Assume that the logic contained within the code is correct and your focus should be on applying clean code principles. The functionality of the service must not change.
Keep in mind principles such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.

Try to limit time spent on this exercise to a maximum of 3 hours. If there is anything you don't have time to complete, write it down and we can discuss it during the interview.

## Limitations
When coding in large solutions there are often limitations where you are unable to make certain changes and this code is no different. Please factor in the following limitations during your refactoring.

1. The contents of Program.cs cannot change at all including using statements.
2. The EmailService project cannot be changed
3. The method signatures in the repositories cannot change
4. The IncidentRepository must remain static

Please submit your refactored code to us via a method of your choice (repository link, cloud share, zip file, etc.) prior to an interview to allow us to review it.
Note that while you can clone this repository, you cannot create a branch or commit any code to the repository. It is read only.

Good Luck!
